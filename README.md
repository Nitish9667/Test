# Test
This is an optional exercise to test your understanding of Python Basics. If you find this extremely challenging, then you probably are not ready for the rest of this course yet and don't have enough programming experience to continue. I would suggest you take another course more geared towards complete beginners, such as [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=PY20)
